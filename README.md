# Cybersecurity
This repository contains a series of three cybersecurity projects focused on network configuration, security policy enforcement, and ethical hacking in a controlled virtual environment using tools like VirtualBox, pfSense, Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Wireshark.

✅ Project 1 – Network Sandbox & Security Policy Implementation
    Created virtual subnets with internal routing
    Applied iptables firewall rules
    Conducted diagnostic analysis with Nmap and Wireshark

✅ Project 2 – Secure Shell Access & Password Cracking
    Analyzed and exploited SSH vulnerabilities
    Used GDB, DVWA, and password cracking via C and Metasploit
    Developed XOR-based decryption and brute-force key retrieval programs

✅ Project 3 – Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Exploits
    Performed remote code execution using MS08-067 & MS12-020
    Executed MITM and SYN Flood attacks
    Attempted malware deployment via embedded PDFs
